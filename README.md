# Renewable Energy

Although renewable energy has become increasingly more popular and accessible, it still represents a very low portion of the overall energy generated and consumed in Maryland - from the datasets extracted, it can be observed that all together, the renewable energy sources represent less than 10% of the energy generated in the State.


The purpose of this app is for the user to have an interactive experience throughout. The datasets are extarcted directly from the government website, so that any user may access it at any time. 

The first tab of the app introduces the the user to the topic and navegation of the page. The user is able to render 2 plots to better understand Maryland's status when in comes to energy. Then the user has access to both datasets to be loaded through the Data tab. The datasets provide both the generation capacity and the recorded generated energy given a particular source, for the State of Maryland. It can be observed that most renewable energy sources, both generation and capacity, have increased significantly thorughout the years.

Lastly, the last two tabs allow the user to plot the datasets individually while selecting the years he/she wishes to analyze.
